# target-intacct
A custom Meltano target that sends data into Intacct.
- The target is based on HotGlueXYZ's [Target-Intacct](https://github.com/hotgluexyz/target-intacct)


## Quick Start

1. Install

   - Clone the Repository 

    - In the root folder run `pip install .`

3. Testing
    - The target is utilized as a component of [Meltano](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/meltano-at-a-glance) pipelines so local changes can be tested by running a pipeline with the target installed as a loader.
